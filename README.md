# HA_RFPlayerNext
New version of Home Assistant RFPlayer Support

This is a reworked version based on my works on the original https://github.com/gce-electronics/HA_RFPlayer

My intent is to directly support all protocols and infotypes listed on API Documentation and use Home assistant recommandations to have a clean component.
